Mocodo is an open-source tool for designing and teaching relational databases. It takes as an input a textual description of both entities and associations of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). It outputs a vectorial drawing in SVG and a relational schema in various formats (SQL, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.).

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Mocodo is to use pip:

::

    pip install mocodo

If this fails, ensure first you have a working Python 3 installation.

Usage
-------

Generate the conceptual diagram of a default ERD:

::

    mocodo

Show the argument list:

::

    mocodo --help
